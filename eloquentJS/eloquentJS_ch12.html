				7 - app layer

							ssh
							http
							ftp
							smtp
							dns

				6 - presentation layer
				
						data translator for the network, often called syntax layer.
							
				5 - session layer
						

				4 - transport layer
				
							tcp
							udp

			datagram = network packet
			
				formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.
		_____

			packet switching

				digital network communications method that groups all transmitted data into suitable sized blocks, called packets, which are transmitted via a medium that may be shared by multiple simultaneous communication sessions.

				packet switching increases network efficiency,robustness and enables technological convergence of many applications operating on the same network.

		RANDOM

			protocol layer examples: examples: protocols for sending email, fetching email, sharing files, etc.
			
			for example, SMTP typically listens through port 25

			internet protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relying datagrams across network boundaries.

			its routing function enables internetworking and essentially establishes the internet.
		
			TCP (transmission control protocol) is 'spoken' by most internet-connected devices.
		
			HTTP usually listens through port 80

			each machine connected to the internet gets a unique IP address
