what is nodeJS?

two categories of what people are doing with node:

	- utilities on the machine (dev)

		- gulp : used for simplicity of configuration files

		- grunt : JS task runner (e.g. minification, compilation, unit testing, linting)

		- yeoman : web scaffolding tool

	- a web server

		- express

		- koa

what are the super basics?

		> node -v 		// returns node's version

		node 			// starts a node process

	in a node process there is no window or documnet because such node is not tied to a browser. there is a process, however.
